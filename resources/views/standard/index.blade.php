                    <p>As many of you may have already heard, we recently lost another long-standing Wisport friend to
                    heart-breaking circumstances. Ken Myszkewicz has been the victim of a tragic crime in his own home.
                    We have been told the Janesville newspaper has been the most accurate source for news during this
                    ordeal, so have attached the link here:</p>

                    <p>Please respect the Myszkewicz’s privacy as they cope with this catastrophe. We will post updates

                    whole family in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.</p>

                <h2>Events</h2>
                <p>WiSport brings together racers and organizers to create a series of fun and challenging events, frequently benefiting community organizations.
                    Not only can you race, but give back in the process. Don't forget most races will feature WiSport member only prize drawings.</p>

                <p>Get your results and standings quick. We usually have all results and standings updated within hours of race completion.
                    Of course, this does depend on the timing companies and web access.</p>

                <p>WiSport is of course about results. But that's not all. There's nothing like being able to relax, maybe enjoy an adult beverage and talk racing, bikes, or whatever.</p>

                    The History- Bicycle racing in the United States has not provided opportunities for the average citizen to participate and therefore compete.  Unlike runningand cross country skiing, which have many opportunities for all age groups and levels of ability bicycle racing opportunities were not available.  This situation changed in 1988 when Jim Menzel of Stevens Point, WI founded WiSport, a citizen bicycle racing organization that fosters participation for gender and age groups.  The premise of WiSport is to support and promote locally sponsored bicycle races and provide a scoring system based on your age and gender, so that each individual is racing against persons in their age group and gender.  Scoring during the racing season is based on participation, the more events you race the higher your score regardless of your place at any specific event. WiSport gives individuals who started bicycle racing later in life a chance to participate against others in their age group and experience the camaraderie that bicycling brings to ones life
                </p>

                <p>
                    WiSport does not sponsor races but rather supports local community events put on by chamber of commerce, Lions clubs, volunteer fire departments and the like.  In this way WiSport not only provides the citizen racer opportunity to participate in bicycle racing but also to participate in local community events.WiSport began with age groups in 5 year increments beginning with 14-19.  At its inception, in 1988, the age groups for men ended with age 45 + and for women 40 +.  Today the age groups continue at 5 year increments; however, today the age groups beginwith 13 and under and end at 80 + for both women and men.  This is a testament of the desire to participate and compete in the life long sport of bicycle racing. WiSport’s age group scoring by participation makes the first 10 riders as important as the last 10 in all racing events which emphasize reward of the effort and not the result.
